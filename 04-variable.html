  <h1>What is a variable?</h1>
  <p>A variable in JavaScript is like a container that holds a value. It's a way for programmers to store data and give
    it a name so they can use it later. For example, if you wanted to keep track of someone's age, you could create a
    variable called "age" and assign a value to it like 10. Then, you could use that variable throughout your program to
    do things like check if someone is old enough to ride a rollercoaster or not. Variables can hold all kinds of
    different values, like numbers, words, or even lists of things.</p>
  <script>
    const person = {
      firstName: 'phil', // property name may be an identifier
      lastName: 'howley', // or a number
      age: 100 // or a string
    };
    console.log(person.age)
  </script>
