  <h1>What are functions in JavaScript?</h1>
  <p>In JavaScript, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It's like a recipe or a set of
    instructions that tells the computer to do something when the function is called.

    Functions can take in input values, called parameters, and can return output values, which are the result of the
    function's calculation. They are used to modularize code, which means to break down large programs into smaller,
    more manageable parts that can be reused or called multiple times.</p>
  <p>Functions can be defined and called anywhere in a JavaScript program, and can be nested inside other functions.
    They are a powerful tool for organizing code and making it easier to read, understand, and maintain.</p>
  <script>
    // This function is called greet and takes in one parameter called name. When the function is called with a value of "John" as the argument, it outputs "Hello, John!" to the console.
    function greet(name) {
      console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }

    greet("John");
     // Output: Hello, John!
     greet("Jo");
     greet("Jane");

  </script>
</body>
