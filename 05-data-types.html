  <h1>Data Types in JavaScript</h1>
  <p>JavaScript has several built-in data types that programmers can use to define variables and manipulate data. Here
    are the most common data types in JavaScript:

    Number: Used to represent both integer and floating-point numbers, such as 3 or 3.14.

    String: Used to represent text, such as "Hello, world!" or "JavaScript is fun!"

    Boolean: Used to represent true or false values, which are used in conditional statements, such as if-else
    statements.

    Null: Used to represent the intentional absence of any object value, meaning the variable has no value.

    Undefined: Used to represent a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

    Object: Used to represent a collection of properties and methods, such as a person object with properties like name,
    age, and address, and methods like walk or run.

    Array: Used to represent a list of values, such as a shopping list or a list of names.

    These data types can be combined and manipulated using various operators and functions in JavaScript to perform
    calculations, manipulate text, compare values, and more.</p>
