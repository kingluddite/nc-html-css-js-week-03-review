    In this example, the variable grade is assigned a value of 80. The if-else if-else statement checks the value of
    grade and prints a message to the console based on the condition that is true.

    Since the value of grade is 80, the condition grade >= 90 is false, and the program moves on to the next condition.
    The condition grade >= 80 is true, so the message "You got a B!" is printed to the console.

    If the value of grade was less than 70, the last else block would have been executed and the message "You need to
    study harder!" would have been printed to the console.

    if-else if-else statements are commonly used in JavaScript to perform different actions based on different
    conditions.

  <script>
    var grade = 70;

    if (grade >= 90) {
      console.log("You got an A!");
    }
