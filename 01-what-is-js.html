  <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
  <p>JavaScript is a computer language that lets people tell computers what to do when they use websites. It's like a
    set of instructions that tells the computer how to do things like make a button change colors when someone clicks on
    it, or make a picture appear when someone moves their mouse over it. Without JavaScript, websites would be very
    static and boring.
