  In JavaScript, every value has an inherent boolean value, which is either true or false. Values that are considered
  true are called "truthy", while values that are considered false are called "falsy".

  Here are the values in JavaScript that are considered falsy:

  false
  0 (numeric zero)
  "" (empty string)
  null
  undefined
  NaN (Not a Number)
  All other values in JavaScript are considered truthy. This includes non-empty strings, non-zero numbers, arrays,
  objects, functions, and more.

  The concept of truthy and falsy values is often used in conditional statements, where a value is evaluated as either
  true or false. For example, in an if statement, a condition that evaluates to a truthy value will execute the block of
  code inside the statement, while a condition that evaluates to a falsy value will skip the block of code.

  Here's an example of using truthy and falsy values in a conditional statement:

  javascript
  Copy code
  var name = "";

  if (name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  } else {
  console.log("Please enter your name.");
  }
  In this example, the variable name is assigned an empty string value, which is a falsy value. When the if statement
  checks the value of name, it evaluates to false because it is a falsy value.

  As a result, the program executes the code inside the else block and prints the message "Please enter your name." to
  the console.


  <script>
    //   In this example, the variable name is assigned an empty string value, which is a falsy value. When the if statement checks the value of name, it evaluates to false because it is a falsy value.

    // As a result, the program executes the code inside the else block and prints the message "Please enter your name." to the console.
    let name = "sean";

    if (name == true) {
      console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    } else {
      console.log("Please enter your name.");
    }


  </script>
